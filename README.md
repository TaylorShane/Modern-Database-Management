# Modern-Database-Management-Project

This repository is to show my extensive work building complex relational database for my Modern Database Management class 
at Northeastern Illinois Univerisity.  The code contains script to create the database objects which include the tables and
primary/foreign key constraints on those tables, indexes, sequences, views, and PL/SQL stored procedures, functions, packages, 
and triggers. Also contained in this repository is documentation related to the database structure such as a 3NF relational 
model, business rules, a data dictionary, ER diagram, and a general description.
